# Frontend Mentor - Fylo dark theme landing page

![Design preview for the Fylo dark theme landing page challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this project.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

Feel free to contribute

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
